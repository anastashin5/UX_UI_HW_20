									<p>Analyze the home page, whether the user will quickly find the right information. In this case, we took the user's certification search path for analysis.</p>

									</div>
								<p><b>USER TESTING PLAN</b></br>We conducted 5 guerilla test. The purpose of these test are to examine how the users interact with the USDA site. We wanted to examine the usability of the site and if it is intuitive. These test help our team to identify paint points, specifically related to UI.</p>
									<p>Test objectives:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>How would users gain information on organic agriculture?</li>
										<li>How would a user learn about becoming organic certified?</li>
										<li>How would users learn about what they need to do to become organic?</li>
									</ul>
								<p><b>HEURISTIC EVALUATION</b></br>We conducted a heuristic evaluation to see where we could find areas of improvement for the site’s UI and to make sure USDA was producing a website that works as users would expect and meets basic standards. </p>
								<p><b>PRIORITIZATION MATRIX</b></br>High Priority items for both USDA and Users include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Strong and easy navigation;</li>
										<li>Easy to find information;</li>
										<li>Concise and clear content being;</li>
										<li>Understand department services and mission on homepage;</li>
										<li>Easy backwards navigation and breadcrumbs.</li>
									</ul>
								<p><b>1.STUDY NAVIGATION BAR:</b></br>From previous interviews, our team noticed that there was some confusion among users when searching for information, possibly due to the wording of the names in the navigation system. Therefore, we appointed additional studies of the site's navigation system.</p>
									<div><img src="images/USDA_flow_nav1.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Flow by navigation">
									</div>
								<p><b>USER TESTING PLAN:</b></br>We conducted 3 guerrilla tests. The purpose of these tests is to study how users interact with the USDA site.</br>In the second phase of testing, we focused on the site's navigation system. Our goal is to identify, re-verify, confirm or refute the previous study of the ORGANIC page, as users were confused when searching for information related to ORGANIC.</p>
									<p><b>Test objectives:</b> Navigate to the area where you would find organic food market information.</p>
								<p><b>2.STUDY NAVIGATION BAR:</b></br>
									Also we explore the path for our second proto-character, a student who is doing agricultural research, studying the effects of pesticides on agriculture, as well as foodborne bacterial pathogens.</br>We will find out whether it is easy to navigate in the information presented, whether the site map is well built and whether the names in the navigation system are understandable.</p>

								<p><b>Test objectives:</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>User needs to go to food safety fact sheets;</li>
										<li>Go to the science behind food safety;</li>
										<li>Find publications in scientific journals on food safety.</li>
									</ul>
								<p><b>TEST RESULT:</b></br>After conducting research and interviews, we found out that, in general, the Ministries of Agriculture site has a good structure, links intersect, the site is informative, and necessary for our users: farmers and government officials, international partners, entrepreneurs, researchers in the field of agriculture and nutrition.</br>
									The site is used by all participants in agriculture and the main purpose of the site is to quickly navigate the site and provide the necessary information to one or another representative of agriculture. The key to success in this task is to build the right navigation system.   The basic principles of good navigation are known to every UX design professional. We will identify and work with several organizational principles that will help us improve the USDA website:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Simple and logical data structure;</li>
										<li>The answer to the question "Where am I?"</li>
									</ul>
								<p><b>TEST RESTING AND PROBLEMS:</b></br>In the course of the study, we identified the main problem: the user is confused in which section to look for information. We came to the conclusion that it is necessary to remake the main page of the site, make it the main navigation for finding the desired section, since, having found the desired section, the user is well-oriented on the secondary pages.</p>

								<p>Another problem on this site is the https://www.usda.gov/topics/organic page. It needs to be streamlined, the user's path needs to be changed, and work has to be done on it.</p>

								<p><b>NEW NAVIGATION BRAINSTORMING</b></p>
								<p>After receiving feedback from our navigation testing, plus our initial observations in our previous tests, we highlighted each current opportunity for navigation on the website using index cards and began considering new groups, titles, and formats for them. The following slides highlight the current platform structure and then the redesigned version during the brainstorming process.</p>
								<p><b>Card sorting</b></br>With the help of card sorting, we have improved navigation on the HOME page.</br>In our study, we used the remote hybrid card sorting method.</br>The study was carried out using card sorting on the Figma board,</br>as on the electronic platform https://www.optimalworkshop.com/ </p>
								<p>At the recommendation of the Nielsen Norman Group, we conducted research with 15 participants to identify patterns in users' mental models.</p>
								<p>Note. The Nielsen Norman Group recommends a card sort with 15 participants. If you invite more, the experience of each additional participant will be less valuable. If less, you will not get enough data to identify patterns in user actions.</p>
								<p><b>SITEMAP REDESIGN:</b></p>
									<ul>
										<li>Based on these organization characteristics and the card sorting brainstorming, we have created the following Site Map that we then used as a template to generate a basic navigation prototype in Figma. </li>
										<li>We have REMOVED the "PRIORITIES" and USDA FAQ's and resources about coronavirus (COVID-19) buttons and added these links (links to information) to the slides.</li>
										<li>We have added ADDITIONAL buttons (sections that will direct the target group to their destination). This is another way for the user to find information quickly.</li>
									</ul>
								<p style="color:#C53636">Corrected</p>
									<div><img src="images/Capture.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Workflow">
									</div>
								<p><b>NEW SITE NAVIGATION</b></p>
								<p>When creating a new information system, we used the principle of "inverted pyramid" the methods of creating a visual hierarchy, the principle of scheme Z.</p>
								<p>We have REMOVED the "PRIORITIES" and USDA FAQ's and resources about coronavirus (COVID-19) buttons and added these links (links to information) to the slides.</p>
								<p>We have also added ADDITIONAL buttons (sections that will direct the target group to their destination). This is another way for the user to find information quickly.</p>
								<p>We will decide on the design in the next session (high-fidelity prototyping).</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-result" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-result-tab">
							<p><b>RESULT</b></br>Initially, the main problem we identified was navigation on the home page.</p>
							<p>The test interview showed that changing the navigation of the home page made it clearer and more interesting. The slides that we placed on the home page brought the site to life, the photos reflect the theme of the links. Also, the buttons: "For farmers", "For partners", "For science" serve as targeted navigation for each category of users (our proto-persons).</p>
							<p><b>DESSIGN SYSTEM</b></p>
							<p>We also tested for color accessibility, as well as text size and font color for the WCAG 2.0 assessment.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>We have made the bottom and top menu buttons of the web page more recognizable and intuitive. We visually separated the buttons, made borders between them.</li>
								<li>We've added a slider that automatically moves when you move the page. This helps to instantly move from the bottom of the page to the top.</li>
								<li>Added color to the "BLOG" button.</li>
								<li>We have made the logo more expressive. We put it on a green background. The web page looks complete.</li>
								<li>In the mobile version, we also added Buttons, a slider, and in the dropdown menu, we highlighted the buttons with a darker color when the cursor is in the bottom area, and also filled the web page with content.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>After completing our Ministry of Agriculture Website Redesign project, five users tested it. Testing showed good results, no errors were found.</p>
							<p>But we found out one very important point: one of the users had color blindness. Although such people are about 1%, this is an important question and it remains open!</p>
						</div>
						<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-conclusion" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-conclusion-tab">
							<p><b>In conclusion, we can say that we coped with the task:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>The site has become more convenient, the architecture of the Home Page has been changed;</li>
									<li>sers of the site are better oriented when searching for information;</li>
									<li>The site has become visually attractive.</li>
								</ul>
							<p>But as they say, there is no limit to perfection! There is always something to work on. And the next step may be the second version of the site, which people with color blindness can read.</p>
							<p>Our team will make the second version of the site. People with this feature of vision will be able to switch to another version of the site.</p>
							<p>We know that people with color blindness see combinations of green and orange almost as one color, so we need to think about this task. But that's next project...</p>
